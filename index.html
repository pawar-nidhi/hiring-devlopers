  <p><em>An individual who makes money on a per-job basis is a freelancer.
     They usually earn on a per-task basis and generally work for a short time.
      In simpler terms, they do not work for a firm. Thus, they enjoy the
       liberty to work on various jobs for different clients simultaneously.</em></p>
       <br>
       <h2><strong>what we are doing?</strong></h2>
       <p><em>we are creating a team of freelancers to devlop a website,
       and to handle many clients togather and creating employements for new
     freelancers.</em></p>
